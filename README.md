# PharmaData_SCC_Study: Statistical and Graphical Analysis of Anti-Cancer Drug Performance

## Project Overview
This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug Capomulin against other treatment regimens in the fight against Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. We leverage data from a recent animal study, where 249 mice identified with SCC tumors were treated with various drug regimens. The study spanned 45 days, during which tumor development was observed and measured.

## Data Visualization
Based on the analysis of the data, here are three observations or inferences that can be made:

Tumor Response to Capomulin: The line plot of tumor volume versus time point for a mouse treated with Capomulin showed a consistent decrease in tumor volume over time. This suggests that Capomulin may be effective in reducing tumor size in mice with squamous cell carcinoma.

Correlation between Mouse Weight and Tumor Volume: The scatter plot and linear regression analysis revealed a positive correlation between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen. As the weight of the mouse increased, the average tumor volume also tended to increase. This indicates that there might be a relationship between these two variables.

Outlier Detection: The box plot analysis of the final tumor volume for the four most promising treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) identified potential outliers for the Infubinol treatment. These potential outliers could be indicative of unusual responses to the treatment or measurement errors.
